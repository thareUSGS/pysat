This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to the Python Spectral Analysis Tool (PySAT). We’ll cover topics such as getting started, opening data files, visualizing spectra, performing spectral analysis and deriving new data products, and generating figures ready for insertion into publications.

## So what is PySAT, exactly?

PySAT is both a Python (2.7+) library, accessible via an API, and a Graphic User Interface.  This project began as a tool to extract Spectral Profiler data and visualize the resultant spectra.  Slowly, additional functionality was required to perform continuum corrections, interact with plotted data, and apply additional spectral analytics.  

Currently, PySAT support Spectral Profiler, Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), and MI data in all formats supported by GDAL, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library.  PySAT is able to extract spectra, support analysis, and derive 8-bit data products. 

## Helpful Hints

Throughout this guide there are a number of small-but-handy pieces of
information that can make using Jekyll easier, more interesting, and less
hazardous. Here’s what to look out for.

<div class="note warning">
  <h5>Warnings help you not blow things up</h5>
  <p>Be aware of these messages if you wish to avoid certain death.</p>
</div>

<div class="note unreleased">
  <h5>You'll see this by a feature that hasn't been released</h5>
  <p>Some pieces of functionality are undergoing internal and, potentially, external testing, with code stored in the [github repository]({{site.repository}}). </p>
</div>

If you come across anything along the way that we haven’t covered, or if you
know of a tip you think others would find handy, please [file an
issue]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new) and we’ll see about
including it in this guide.

## Jekyll Licensing and Documentation Layout
We are indebted to the Jekyll team, for providing both the ability to seamlessly integrate these docs into a Github page and for licensing their website using an unrestrictive open-source license.  We are adapting their documentation layout and style to our use.

Therefore, we have included the Jekyll licensing as our documentation layout is a derived product.
