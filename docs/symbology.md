Symbology is broadly divided into color ramps used for map visualization and plot symbology used for line and point representation.

##Color Ramps \& Color Bars


##Plot Symbology

PySAT attempts to natively handle the most common synbology requirements without need for user interaction.  For example, PySAT cycles coloration of spectra to correspond to points plotted in a map frame.

Finer control of the symbology of all elements within a plot are provided via the navigation toolbar.
