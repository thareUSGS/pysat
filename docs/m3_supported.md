Currently, we support Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) data in PDS <code>.img</code> format.

<div class="note">
  <h5>M3 Data Identification</h5>
  <p>We have not identified a unique identifier within the PDS M3 label that allows our driver to definitiely identify M3 datasets.  Therefore, we open a dialog and ask you to identify the data type.  If you know of a unique identifier within the PDS label, [file and issue]({{site.repository}}/issues/new) and let us know.</p>
</div>
