PySAT leverages the [MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org) library to handle all of the plotting.  This includes the display of image data, that is read using [GDAL](http://gdal.org) and stored as an array.

##Plot Types
PySAT support single and stacked plotting in an effort to provide both exploratory data analysis capabilities and presentation ready figures.

##Interactive Navigation
Matplotlib provides interactive navigation within a plot window via the navigation toolbar.
