Major updates to PySAT including:

- Alpha spectral calculator that allows for simple mathematical expressions.  Not all calculator functions are working, but paranthesis and basic math are in.
- Better integration between MGM and PySAT main.
- Cassini VIMs reader added.  For level 1 images.  See [VIMS Reader](../docs/vims) for more information.
- Mean spectra by bounding box added to the map plot window.  
- RELAB support added.
- Alpha map as QT pixmap (turned off).  This significantly improves render performance for large images wrapped in no data at the expense of having to hand code a lot more functionality.  Currently in the codebase as a proof of concept for large images.
